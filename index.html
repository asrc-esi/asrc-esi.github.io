					<p>Environmental and ecosystem services are essential for human life and are critical for economic development. Growing demands for environmental services will require new approaches for sustainable use, not just through use of and investment in technology but also through new and integrated ways of assessment.</p>
					<p>Building on our legacy of environmental research, we have developed a novel approach that fuses corporate information with environmental assessments at the global scale to understand the local impacts of corporations on environmental systems/nature, particularly water.</p>
					<p>We strive to:
						<ul>
							<li>Help businesses and investors to identify and measure their environmental-related risks and impacts</li>
							<li>Provide a robust systematic framework with traceable indicators of environmental system impacts</li>
							<li>Measure the impact of company-specific activities on the security of ecosystem services and ecosystem sustainability</li>
							<li>Identify business and investment opportunities to increase ecosystem services for people and businesses</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>We provide new ways of assessing businesses by taking into consideration green infrastructure benefits not just to humans, but also to the environment. The interconnected nature of global environmental challenges makes it insufficient to only rely on man-made (engineered) solutions.</p>

								<p><a href="mailto:charles.vorosmarty@asrc.cuny.edu">charles.vorosmarty@asrc.cuny.edu</a></p>
								<p>Charles Vörösmarty, PhD is the Founding Director of the Environmental Sciences Initiative at the CUNY Advanced Science Research Center. His research focuses on the development of computer models and geospatial data sets used in synthesis studies of the interactions among the water cycle, climate, biogeochemistry and anthropogenic activities. His studies are built around local, regional and continental to global-scale modeling of water balance, discharge, constituent fluxes in river systems and the analysis of the impacts of large-scale water engineering on the terrestrial water cycle. His work on human-water interactions includes earth system modeling of the Northeastern United States, development and analysis of databases depicting reservoir construction worldwide and how they generate downstream coastal zone risks, and global threats to human water security and aquatic biodiversity.</p>
								<p>He routinely provides scientific guidance to a variety of U.S. and international water consortia. He is a founding member and current co-Chair of the Global Water System Project that represents the input of several hundred international scientists under the International Council for Science’s Global Environmental Change Programs. He is spearheading efforts to develop global-scale indicators of water stress and is working with chief United Nations delegates who are negotiating the Rio+20 Sustainable Development Goals. He has served on a broad array of national panels, including the U.S. Arctic Research Commission (appointed by Presidents Bush and Obama), the NASA Earth Science Subcommittee, the National Research Council Committee on Hydrologic Science as Chair, a member of the NRC Review Committee on the U.S. Global Change Research Program, the National Science Foundation’s Arctic System Science Program Committee, and the Arctic HYDRA International Polar Year Planning Team. He also was a consultant to the 24-agency United Nations World Water Assessment Programme and represented the International Council of Scientific Unions at the UN Commission on Sustainable Development meetings.</p>
